<h2>Description</h2>
CNN Fashion MNIST Project with TensorFlow

This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow library to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of clothing items, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 different classes.

The main objective of this project is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify the different fashion items in the dataset. By leveraging the power of convolutional layers, the CNN can effectively capture spatial patterns and features present in the images, making it well-suited for image classification tasks.

The project utilizes TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, which provides a robust set of tools and utilities for developing and training deep learning models.

The implementation follows a series of essential steps. First, the Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed, which typically involves normalizing the pixel values and converting the labels into categorical form.

Next, a CNN model is constructed using the TensorFlow framework, leveraging its high-level API, Keras. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, which are responsible for extracting features from the input images, followed by one or more fully connected layers that perform the final classification. Additionally, other layers such as pooling layers and dropout layers may be included to enhance the model's performance and reduce overfitting.

After building the model, it is trained using the training set of the Fashion MNIST dataset. The training process involves iteratively presenting batches of input images to the model, calculating the loss between the predicted and actual labels, and updating the model's weights using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using the testing set of the Fashion MNIST dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and others are computed to assess the model's performance in classifying the different fashion items.

The code for this project can be found in the GitHub repository, along with any necessary instructions or dependencies. The repository serves as a valuable resource for developers and machine learning enthusiasts who want to explore and experiment with CNN models for image classification tasks using TensorFlow and the Fashion MNIST dataset.

By examining this project, users can gain hands-on experience with building, training, and evaluating CNN models for fashion item classification, while also understanding the fundamentals of TensorFlow and its integration with deep learning models.
